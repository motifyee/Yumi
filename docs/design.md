# App Design Document

2. Introduction
   Purpose: To provide a detailed design framework for the 3 Yumi apps, which aims to facilitate order delivery from close chefs to customers.
   Scope: This document covers the app’s design aspects, including UI/UX, architecture, and data management.

3. User Interface Design
   [✅] Color Scheme: A palette of enticing red to evoke a sense of food desire.
   Typography: ‘Roboto’ for body text and ‘Montserrat’ for headings, ensuring readability.
   [✅] Iconography: Custom icons representing different cousines, locations, and actions like ordering, scheduling and more.

4. User Experience
   [❌] User Flow: A step-by-step walkthrough of the user’s journey from onboarding to ordering and dispute.
   [❌] Wireframes: Sketches of each screen layout and the transitions between them.
   [✅] Mockups: High-fidelity designs showcasing the final look of the app’s interface.

5. Architectural Design
   **State Management**: Utilizing Bloc:

   - Bloc for:
     - Event driven arch
     - Tracking event changes, traceability, debugging
     - Stream transformations (e.g. restartable, droppable, debouncing, caching => chat, backend search)
     - API that need transforming data before rendering [⁉]
   - Cubit for:
     - When Bloc is't needed
     - login, theme

   **Respositories**:
   **Folder Structure**:

6. Functional Requirements
   **Authentication**: Secure login with email/password and social media integration(fb, apple, google).

   **Registeration**: Special registeration flow for each app including onboarding.

   **Search**: Filters for sorting and finding the best meals/chefs.

   **Ordering**: With payment gateway integration.

   **Dispute**: Allow customrs to dispute against chefs/drivers.

7. Non-Functional Requirements

   **Performance**: App must load content within 2 seconds on a standard 4G network.
   **Security**: End-to-end encryption for all sensitive user data.
   **Accessibility**: Compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards for accessibility.

8. Testing Strategy
   Unit Testing: Coverage of all business logic components.
   Integration Testing: End-to-end testing of critical user flows.
   Performance Testing: Load testing to ensure stability under high usage.

9. Deployment Plan
   CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment setup with GitHub Actions.
   Beta Testing: Distribution through TestFlight and Google Play Beta.
   Release: Staged rollout starting with a 10% user base to monitor initial feedback.

10. Maintenance and Support
    Monitoring: Real-time monitoring with Firebase Analytics.
    Updates: Bi-weekly updates for feature enhancements and bug fixes.
    Support: 24/7 customer support with an in-app chat feature.

11. Appendices
    A. API Documentation: Detailed description of all backend services.
    B. Legal: Terms of service and privacy policy.
    C. Mockups and Wireframes: Visual representations of UI components.
